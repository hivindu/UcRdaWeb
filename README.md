This application is developed as my final year sole project. This is the web application that i have proposed to use in RDA and UC in sri lanka. This application is capable of retrieve the reported issues by the citizens of sri lanka and also RDA is able to assign task to their group leaders in their administrative area. Workers who recived work from the RDA can retrive the assigned task and update the status of assigned tasks.
